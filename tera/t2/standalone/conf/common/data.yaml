# persistent storage type
# could be: hdfs, mounted, none
# mounted can be local disk or a network mounted disk such as nfs
# by default, it is "mounted"
# twister2.persistent.storage.type: "mounted"

# persistent storage root
# a directory with jobID is created under this directory
# all persistent storage related files are stored under that directory for the job
# for hdfs, it can be something like:
# twister2.persistent.storage.root: "/twister2"
# for mounted disks, it can be something like
twister2.persistent.storage.root: "${HOME}/.twister2/jobs"

# volatile storage root
# when twister2 can not fit the tset data into the memory and useDisk is specified,
#   it saves to this location during the computation
# when twister2 networking can not fit the data into the allocated memory,
#   it saves to this location
# networking component may also save to multiple disks concurrently
#   for that to happen, multiple roots need to be specified
#   tset component currently saves to a single disk only.
#   (first one in the list when there are multiple)
# by default, it is ["/tmp/twister2/volatile"]
twister2.volatile.storage.root: ["/scratch/auyar/terasort"]

# tset data can be saved to disk when the data can not fit into the memory
# by default, it is saved to the mounted disk
# it can also be saved to hdfs
# supported values: "mounted" or "hdfs"
# twister2.tset.storage.type: "mounted"

# logging storage type
# twister2 can save logs to volatile or persistent storage
# however, we do not support hdfs as the persistent storage for logging yet
# supported values: "volatile" or "persistent"
# by default, it is "volatile"
# twister2.logging.storage.type: "volatile"
